Hero background video (Landing page)
====================================

To enable the cinematic ambient video in the Hero section:

1. Add a file named: hero-bg.webm

2. Format: .webm (lightweight, fast). Place in this folder (apps/web/public/).

3. The page uses 60% black overlay over the video so white text stays readable.
   If the file is missing, the Hero still shows a dark background.

Prompt for video generators (Runway, Luma, etc.)
------------------------------------------------
Use this exact prompt to generate the perfect hero background:

  "Cinematic drone shot of a futuristic smart city at night. Dark aesthetic,
   deep blue and black tones. Neon digital grid lines and data nodes pulsing
   over the building rooftops. High-end, sleek, professional tech atmosphere.
   4K, slow motion."

Goal: "The digital layer over the physical world" – not generic stock of
buildings or people. Vantera = the intelligence layer above the concrete.
