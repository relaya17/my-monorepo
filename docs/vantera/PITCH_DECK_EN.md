## "Managing the future, $3 at a time."

## Slide 1: The Problem (The Pain)

**Building management is stuck in 1990.**

- **Lack of transparency:** Residents don't know where their money goes
- **Reactive maintenance:** Wait for something to break before fixing it (expensive and stressful)
- **Outdated technology:** Management via WhatsApp, emails, and paper

**Result:** Buildings deteriorate, property value drops, and residents are frustrated.
