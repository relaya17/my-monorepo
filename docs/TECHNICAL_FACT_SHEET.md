## Why $3 Translates to Billions in Company Value

- **Penetration:** $3 is a no-resistance price — boards approve instantly; 100% adoption within a building is realistic.
- **Unit economics:** At scale, marginal cost per building approaches zero; gross margin expands.
- **Upside:** Service Marketplace (insurance, extras) and Smart City data turn $3 into a platform with multiple revenue layers.
- **Valuation:** Recurring revenue from hundreds of thousands of units, plus data and ecosystem, supports premium multiples.
